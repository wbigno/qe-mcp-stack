## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load data"

- **Check**: Orchestrator is running (`docker ps | grep orchestrator`)
- **Check**: Port 3000 is accessible (`curl http://localhost:3000/health`)
- **Check**: Azure DevOps MCP is healthy

### Story analysis returns error

- **Check**: Story ID is valid
- **Check**: Azure DevOps MCP can access the work item
- **Check**: STDIO MCPs are configured (requirements-analyzer, test-case-planner)

### No data appears

- **Check**: Browser console (F12) for errors
- **Check**: API endpoint is correct (should be port 3000)
- **Try**: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
