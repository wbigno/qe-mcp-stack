## CRITICAL: Development Process Requirements

### MANDATORY: Before ANY Code Changes
1. **ALWAYS read and understand existing code first**
   - Show me what you found and your understanding
   - Ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear
   - Explain your planned approach before coding

2. **ALWAYS check for related files**
   - Find all files that might be affected
   - List them explicitly before making changes
   - Explain why each file needs to change

3. **ALWAYS provide complete, working code**
   - NO placeholders like "// ... rest of code ..."
   - NO "// Add error handling here" comments
   - Every code block must be complete and executable
   - Include ALL imports, ALL functions, ALL error handling

### MANDATORY: After ANY Code Changes
4. **ALWAYS test your changes mentally first**
   - Walk through the code execution path
   - Identify potential edge cases
   - List what could go wrong
   - Explain how errors are handled

5. **ALWAYS provide verification steps**
   - Give me exact commands to test
   - Show expected output vs actual output
   - Provide curl commands or HTTP file examples
   - Include both success and failure test cases

6. **ALWAYS check for breaking changes**
   - Will this break existing functionality?
   - Are there dependencies that need updating?
   - Do any tests need to be modified?
   - List all files that interact with this code

### MANDATORY: Error Handling Requirements
7. **EVERY function must have error handling**
   - Wrap in try/catch blocks
   - Return structured errors: { error, message, details }
   - Log errors with full context
   - Never let errors silently fail

8. **EVERY API endpoint must validate input**
   - Check for required parameters
   - Validate data types
   - Sanitize user input
   - Return clear error messages

### MANDATORY: Code Quality Standards
9. **Code MUST be production-ready**
   - Add JSDoc comments to ALL functions
   - Use descriptive variable names (no x, y, z)
   - No magic numbers (use named constants)
   - Follow existing code style exactly

10. **Documentation MUST be complete**
    - Every change requires explanation
    - Update README if behavior changes
    - Add inline comments for complex logic
    - Include usage examples

### FORBIDDEN Practices (NEVER DO THESE)
❌ NEVER use placeholders in code
❌ NEVER skip error handling
❌ NEVER omit validation
❌ NEVER forget to test
❌ NEVER make assumptions without asking
❌ NEVER provide partial code
❌ NEVER say "similar pattern" - show the FULL code
❌ NEVER skip explaining your changes
❌ NEVER forget about edge cases
❌ NEVER ignore existing patterns in the codebase

### Required Response Format
When making ANY code change, structure your response as:

**1. ANALYSIS**
   - What I found in the existing code
   - What needs to change and why
   - Potential impacts on other files
   - Edge cases to consider

**2. PLAN**
   - Step-by-step implementation plan
   - Files that will be modified
   - New files that will be created
   - Dependencies that need updating

**3. IMPLEMENTATION**
   - Complete, working code (no placeholders)
   - All necessary imports
   - Full error handling
   - All edge cases handled

**4. VERIFICATION**
   - Exact test commands
   - Expected vs actual output
   - Success test cases
   - Failure test cases
   - Integration test examples

**5. CHECKLIST**
   - [ ] Code is complete (no TODOs)
   - [ ] Error handling added
   - [ ] Input validation added
   - [ ] Tests provided
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   - [ ] No breaking changes OR migration plan provided
   - [ ] Edge cases handled
   - [ ] Follows existing patterns

## Architecture Principles (MUST FOLLOW)

### MCP Structure
- Docker MCPs: MUST have /health endpoint that returns 200
- STDIO MCPs: MUST accept JSON stdin, output JSON stdout
- ALL MCPs: MUST have index.js, package.json, README.md, Dockerfile
- Register in orchestrator/src/services/mcpManager.js
- Add to docker-compose.yml with sequential port

### Coding Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- ES6 modules: import/export (NOT require/module.exports)
- async/await for ALL async operations (NO callbacks, NO .then())
- File naming: kebab-case (my-service.js)
- Variable naming: camelCase (myVariable)
- Class naming: PascalCase (MyClass)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (MAX_RETRIES)
- JSDoc comments on EVERY function
- Structured logging: logger.info/error/warn

### Error Handling (REQUIRED EVERYWHERE)
```javascript
// CORRECT - This is the ONLY acceptable pattern
try {
  const result = await someOperation();
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Operation failed', { error: error.message, stack: error.stack });
  return { 
    success: false, 
    error: 'Operation failed', 
    message: error.message,
    details: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? error.stack : undefined
  };
}
```

### Input Validation (REQUIRED FOR ALL APIS)
```javascript
// CORRECT - Validate BEFORE processing
app.post('/api/analyze', async (req, res) => {
  // Step 1: Validate required fields
  const { app, type } = req.body;
  if (!app) {
    return res.status(400).json({ 
      error: 'Missing required parameter', 
      message: 'app is required' 
    });
  }

  // Step 2: Validate data types
  if (typeof app !== 'string') {
    return res.status(400).json({ 
      error: 'Invalid parameter type', 
      message: 'app must be a string' 
    });
  }

  // Step 3: Process
  try {
    const result = await processRequest(app, type);
    res.json({ success: true, data: result });
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Request failed', { error, app, type });
    res.status(500).json({ 
      error: 'Processing failed', 
      message: error.message 
    });
  }
});
```

### Testing Requirements (MUST PROVIDE)
When creating/modifying ANY endpoint:
1. Create .http file with test cases
2. Show curl commands
3. Include success case
4. Include failure cases (missing params, invalid data, server error)
5. Test with actual service running

### Docker Conventions (MUST FOLLOW)
- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Health checks that actually work: `curl -f http://localhost:PORT/health`
- Sequential port numbers (check docker-compose.yml for next available)
- restart: unless-stopped
- Named volumes for persistence
- Proper logging configuration

### Dashboard Development (CSP COMPLIANT)
- NO inline JavaScript (use addEventListener)
- NO onclick attributes in HTML
- Modular functions in script.js
- Progressive enhancement
- Responsive design

## When I Ask You To...

### "Add a feature"
1. First, ask me clarifying questions
2. Show me the existing code structure
3. Explain your implementation plan
4. Get my approval before coding
5. Provide complete, tested implementation
6. Give me verification steps

### "Fix a bug"
1. Ask me to reproduce the issue
2. Analyze the root cause
3. Explain what's wrong
4. Propose a solution
5. Show the fix with tests
6. Explain why it won't happen again

### "Refactor code"
1. Show current code structure
2. Explain what's wrong with it
3. Propose better structure
4. Show complete refactored code
5. Provide migration steps if needed
6. List all affected files

### "Add tests"
1. Analyze existing code
2. Identify test cases (success, edge, failure)
3. Write complete test file
4. Show how to run tests
5. Show expected output

## Quality Checklist (USE THIS EVERY TIME)

Before responding, verify:
- [ ] Did I read and understand the existing code?
- [ ] Did I provide COMPLETE code (no placeholders)?
- [ ] Did I add error handling EVERYWHERE?
- [ ] Did I validate ALL inputs?
- [ ] Did I include JSDoc comments?
- [ ] Did I follow the existing code style?
- [ ] Did I provide test commands?
- [ ] Did I explain my changes?
- [ ] Did I check for breaking changes?
- [ ] Did I handle edge cases?
- [ ] Would this code pass code review?
- [ ] Can the user copy-paste and run this immediately?

## Remember
- SLOW DOWN - Speed causes bugs
- THINK FIRST - Then code
- TEST MENTALLY - Walk through execution
- BE COMPLETE - No shortcuts
- BE THOROUGH - Check everything
- BE HELPFUL - Explain clearly
